        <p>We have done three small programmes during our second class.</p>
<p>(i).  Firstly, we tried to make the equipment which would be able to displace the automatic light we use to light up the way we walk at the night.</p>
<p><strong>An infrared sensor was used in the equipment as a core component.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/acBQUK" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/06/acBQUK.png" alt="acBQUK.png"></a></p>
<p><strong>We design the code as below</strong></p>
<p>void setup() {</p>
<p>// initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.</p>
<p>pinMode(8, OUTPUT);</p>
<p>pinMode(7, INPUT);</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>// the loop function runs over and over again forever</p>
<p>void loop() {</p>
<p>if(digitalRead(7)){</p>
<p>digitalWrite(8, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>else{</p>
<p>digitalWrite(8, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW</p>
<p>When there is someone passes by the sensor the sensor will considered the signal as “1” and higher the voltage of the light to make it light up.</p>
<p>(ii). The second design we make has almost the same route to use in our daily life. However, we use a sound senor instead.</p>
<p>A sound sensor is shown below</p>
<p> <a href="https://imgchr.com/i/acBuHx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/06/acBuHx.png" alt="acBuHx.png"></a></p>
<p><strong>We used almost the same code as the infrared sensor</strong> </p>
<p>void setup() {</p>
<p>// initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.</p>
<p>pinMode(8, OUTPUT);</p>
<p>pinMode(7, INPUT);</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>// the loop function runs over and over again forever</p>
<p>void loop() {</p>
<p>if(digitalRead(7)){</p>
<p>digitalWrite(8, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)</p>
<p><strong>delay(3000)</strong></p>
<p>}</p>
<p>else{</p>
<p>digitalWrite(8, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW</p>
<p>However, “delay” was added in the code to ensure the light will maintain bright enough for 3 seconds (3000 means 3000 milliseconds)</p>
<p>(iii). Finally, we use temperature sensor to simulate the computer cooling fan.</p>
<p>Here shows the equipment I have made below</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/acB3CD" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/06/acB3CD.md.jpg" alt="acB3CD.md.jpg"></a></p>
<p>#include&lt;OneWire.h&gt;</p>
<p>#include&lt;DallasTemperature.h&gt;</p>
<p>#define BUS 7</p>
<p>OneWire onewire(BUS);</p>
<p>DallasTemperature senors(&amp;onewire);</p>
<p>void setup(){</p>
<p> // put your setup code here, to run once:</p>
<p> Serial.begin(9600);</p>
<p> senors.begin();</p>
<p> pinMode(8,OUTPUT);</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>void loop(){</p>
<p> // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:</p>
<p> senors.requestTemperatures();</p>
<p> Serial.write(“温度：”);</p>
<p> Serial.print(senors.getTempCByIndex(0));</p>
<p> Serial.println(“摄氏度”);</p>
<p> digitalWrite(8,LOW);</p>
<p> if (senors.getTempCByIndex(0)&gt;34){</p>
<p>  digitalWrite(8,HIGH);</p>
<p> }</p>
<p> }</p>
<p>Here are some photos of testing the temperature sensor</p>

        <p>​        Eiffel Tower is the landmark of the Paris or even France. It is used to be the world’s tallest building which is up to 324 metres in its height. It is named after the famous French architect Gustave Eiffel. </p>
<p>​        It is located at the ‘Champ-de-Mars’ with the restaurants and shops under the tower. There is a spire needle on the top of the tower, the tower are divided into three parts and the bottom width of the tower is 100 metres. The first and the second floor of the tower are provided with food to eat and place for take a rest. Moreover, there is a view platform on the third floor. </p>
<p>​        Eiffel Tower is opened from 9:30 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. during Jan.1 to Jun.15 and Sept.3 to Dec.31. And it is opened from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. during Jun.16 to Sept.2. We need to plan our time well when we are preparing for visiting as there are more than 270 million people visit there in average.</p>
<p>​        The Eiffel Tower was built by Gustave Eiffel for the 100th year of the French freedom. At first, the Eiffel Tower was to be made in Barcelona, Spain, but the people of Barcelona did not want it. When the tower was built, it was only meant to be kept for 20 years. People did not like the Eiffel Tower and wanted it taken down. After the 20 years ,the tower became the property of Paris again. By this time, the city had learned that the tower could be used to help with communications. The military used the tower to communicate during battle.</p>
<p>​        In conclusion, it is one of the world’s greatest building.</p>

        <p>​       Through the learning of the IELTS class, it is interested to find out that there is a close connection between Economic problem and the IELTS writing.</p>
<p>​       Many method of analysis economic problem can be used properly and suitably in writing. Such as, when the question ask you about whether the building of a new bridge in a rural area is benefit or not. And it can be explained as that the building of the bridge can reduce the cost of transportation which can reduce the price of the goods and lower the selling price of the goods which is produced by the village like crops. The lower price makes the goods form that area has more competitiveness than the others, so the demands for the goods increase which helps people gain more revenue from their goods. And it helps increase their income and they are able to improve their living standards. </p>
<p>​        The building of bridge makes the transport between cities and the rural area more convince it enable to push the development of the travelling industry. The culture was also able to be developed as the development of the travelling industry.</p>
<p>​        From the analysis above, we can see the methods of explaining economic problems. I was thought about that the examiner may be just want the exam takers to develop an ability of thinking about our society and try to think about the problem we are facing and trying to solve. Just like the economic problems, to answer these questions we need a clear logic between each explanation you want to show to the examiner. </p>
<p>It helps me a lot to write some of the opinions by using some economic knowledge and I think that we are necessary to try to put our knowledge in series. </p>

        <p>I have once got a small challenge which is the experience that I have lost my way with my friends in the USA.</p>
<p>I went to the USA for a visit with my good friends in summer holiday. The goal of our trip is study at the Space Camp in the Houston and it take up most of our time during the journey. We incidentally visited many places of interests during our 3-week-trip. I found that the buildings in the USA has a completely different style of design compared with those in China, so we easily got lost in some big museum or parks.</p>
<p>When we visited the Disneyland Park in the New York, we got lost here. We acquired a map which is fixed together with the ticket. But the fact is that the map is so simple that we can’t get the detailed information we want which allowed to help us travel smoothly in the park. So we managed to find some free maps from the gate, the map marks all the location of entertainment machine and the shops the lakes and all the things. However, we found that we even don’t know where we are on the maps there are so many crossing roads in the gate we just lost our way just at the gate. We walked around the streets and found some shops which is mentioned on the maps and after a long time exploration. And we finally found out where we are on the map and went on our trip to the Disneyland.</p>
<p>I felt very interesting about the experience and I felt it was necessary to know how to read a map. It was also a special part of our fantastic trip.</p>

        <p>​        I started learning python about a month ago. The learning experience of basics of the software Visual Basic which is taught in the school makes me feel quite familiar with the grammar and the type of variables. To make the program more clearly and easier to run the program without checking it again and again we choose to use Jupyter Notebook to done the program.</p>
<p>​        Python is one of the most common computer languages. It has been used in many different areas, for example, the GUI development, some simple Program compilation and the scientific calculation. I want to do some data analysis by using the language and the python is the most suitable for me who is a green hand in the computer language learning. It would take me least time to done the most work when doing data analysis by using the python.</p>
<p>​        I found that the computer language learning is an interesting process, I could do some simple program during each period of learning. I was able to find out my progress by writing the program with more complex and longer logic. For example, I wrote a small process which set the Username and Password. At first, if you typed in wrong username or password, the program needed to be restarted and type in all the data again. While, through some learning you would able to type in your username wrongly, you would be asked to type it again, so do the password. If you have typed in wrong username or password for over 5 times you are unable to try again and not allowed entering the website. </p>

        <p>I learnt about the Electric and Electronic Engineering major from the official website of the university this week. I got an integrated understanding of the major from the subject I should learn if I choose the major to the project we may take part in in the 3 year study.</p>
<p>We will learn about different subjects such as analogue and digital electronics, communication and control, alongside mathematics and computing modules in year 1 and year 2. Of course, we are able to choose extra subjects which we interested in. In year 3, we will choose the topic we like in a series of widen and boarden topics of electrical and electronic engineering. </p>
<p>The reason why I am interested in this major is that the Electric and Electronic Engineering is a major at the forefront of the challenge to connect our world. I can learn more about cutting-edge knowledge of the world and I am able to use the knowledge to innovate and try to improve some devices to benefit the society.</p>
<p>We will be fully equipped to demonstrate all your knowledge, skills and innovation in a large and ambitious individual project in our final year. I think that it would be a great chance to show myself and get precious experience of cooperation and innovation. </p>
<p>I really learnt a lot from the website and I will learn about more majors in the future from the website.</p>
